# About Me

Greetings all! I'm RoboticForest.

I'm an initially self-taught programmer and have been continually improving my skills since I started back in 1999.

Currently I'm working through my final semester at Willamette University. In between assignments for a Python class I really don't need, I've been working on a C++ and [SDL2](http://libsdl.org/) based game engine as my thesis project. Since starting the project I've learned *a lot* about CMake and a decent amount about git and GitHub too. I plan to continue working on my engine long after school ends, and with it being for my own personal skill improvement I'm not sure yet if I want to eventually open source it.

The best way to contact me at the moment is through my [school email](mailto:dcvitez@willamette.edu). If you want to see progress on my game engine check out my [tumblr blog](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/rfgameproject) about it.
