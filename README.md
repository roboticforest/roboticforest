# About Me

Greetings all!

I'm Robotic Forest. ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ² You can call me Rob. or Forest, but most people call me Dave.

I taught myself QBasic, C++, and HTML4 back in 1999 as a kid, kept improving and learning, and just graduated from Willamette University with a BA in Computer Science! ðŸ¥³

# My Projects

## Current Projects

### Game Engine

Around college I've been working on a C++ and [SDL2](http://libsdl.org/) based game engine (in a private repo). Since starting the project I've learned *a lot* about CMake and a decent amount about git and GitHub too. I plan to continue working on my engine indefinitely, and with it being for my own personal skill improvement I'm not sure yet if I want to eventually open source it.

That said, I *did* get permission to continue work on my game engine for my university thesis and you can [read my report](http://hdl.handle.net/10177/6916) on Willamette University's Academic Commons archive.

I've made a [secondary Tumblr blog](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/rfgameproject) where I periodically post progress notes.

### Personal Website

I have a [website](http://www.roboticforest.com) and am currently rebuilding it from scratch. I threw one together in haste back when I first bought hosting and now I'm trying to make it look much nicer. Like my game engine I've been picking at it in my spare time around much more important work.
