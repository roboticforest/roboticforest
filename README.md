# About Me

Greetings all!

I'm Robotic Forest. ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ²

You can call me Rob. or Forest, but most people call me Dave.

I taught myself QBasic, C++, and HTML4 back in 1999 as a kid, kept improving and learning, and just graduated from Willamette University with a BA in Computer Science! ðŸ¥³

## Recent Engineering Work

Around college I've been working on a C++ and [SDL2](http://libsdl.org/) based game engine (in a private repo). Since starting the project I've learned *a lot* about CMake and a decent amount about git and GitHub too. I plan to continue working on my engine indefinitely, and with it being for my own personal skill improvement I'm not sure yet if I want to eventually open source it.

That said, I *did* get permission to continue work on my game engine for my university thesis and you can [read my report](http://hdl.handle.net/10177/6916) on Willamette University's Academic Commons archive.

## Contacting Me

The best way to contact me at the moment is through my [professional GMail](mailto:david.c.vitez@gmail.com).

## Past Projects

[This repo](https://github.com/roboticforest/touchboard-pro) describes TouchBoard Pro, the first commercial program I helped engineer.

[This repo](https://github.com/roboticforest/school-work-graveyard/tree/main/wu-python-final-project) describes my final project for a Python 3 class.

[This repo](https://github.com/roboticforest/school-work-graveyard/tree/main/wu-haskell-final-project) describes my final project for a Haskell class.

<!--
And, [here is all the rest](https://github.com/roboticforest/school-work-graveyard) of my college work, both from PCC and WU.

## Current Projects

If you want to see progress on my game engine check out my [tumblr blog](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/rfgameproject) about it.

Beyond that, I don't have a lot of other non-school projects going on *yet*. I've spent the last two years pouring myself into university work and have done the bulk of my software engineering during that time in all sorts of class assignments, most of it using Python 3.

I have quite a few game ideas (and a few other programs) in mind and will be starting those projects as soon as I finish switching life tracks from university to full-time work.
